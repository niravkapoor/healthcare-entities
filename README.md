# Healthcare-entities

We are given a data set in which a lot of text is written related to the medical domain. As we can see in the dataset, there are a lot of diseases that can be mentioned in the entire dataset and their related treatments are also mentioned implicitly in the text. For example a given disease is cancer and it's treatment can be identified as chemotherapy using the sentence.

But, note that it is not explicitly mentioned in the dataset about the diseases and their treatment, but somehow, we have to build an algorithm to map the diseases and their respective treatment.

## Dataset

train_sent: In Dataset, sentences are provided in the word format, where each line is a word word a sentence. And sentence ends with a white space.
train_label: labels associated with each word.
